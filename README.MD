## Keep in mind

### Proxy usage

- results provided from `proxy` sometimes change the results, like for example links to the pages can look different,
- Some `proxy` will still get banned when calling some engines,
- Some `proxy` works fine for certain engines, for other it actually causes some issues,
- `proxy` can also malform results sometimes because some engines provide results based on ip location,
